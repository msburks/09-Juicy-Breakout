# Juicy Breakout

I have created a story mode, whereas I could add as many levels as would like to, but for this case I have only included a couple.

There is a page signaling you have won the game, as well as one letting you know that you lost.

I have included all original artwork, sprites, and music into the game, giving insight into the artistic capablilities I am hoping to bring to all of my projects going forward. There are some extra scenes and what not from things I was attempting to include but didn't in the finished game.

Control the platform with the mouse, and attempt to break all the blocks, without losing all your lives!

Enjoy!
